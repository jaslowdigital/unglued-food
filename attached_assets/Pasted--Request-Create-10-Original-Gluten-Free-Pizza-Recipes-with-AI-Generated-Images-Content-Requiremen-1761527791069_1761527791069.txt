🍕 Request: Create 10 Original Gluten-Free Pizza Recipes with AI-Generated Images
Content Requirements:

Please develop 10 unique gluten-free pizza recipes, each featuring a distinct type of gluten-free dough, with the following specifications:

All recipes must be 100% original and not duplicate any existing recipes on our website.

Each recipe title must include “Gluten-Free Pizza” and specify the dough type or base (examples:

Each recipe should include:

Full ingredients list (for both crust and toppings)

Step-by-step preparation instructions (dough mixing, resting, baking, topping)

Prep time, rise time, bake time, and total time

Yield and nutritional breakdown (calories, macros, fiber, etc.)

All ingredients and flours must be certified gluten-free.

Each recipe must highlight a unique crust texture (crispy, chewy, thin, fluffy, etc.) and complementary topping pairings.

Image Requirements:

Generate one high-quality, photorealistic image per recipe.

Each image should showcase the whole pizza and one sliced view, highlighting texture, cheese melt, and crust color.

Use natural lighting with a rustic, casual pizza-night atmosphere (wooden boards, stone plates, herbs, melted cheese strings).

Maintain consistent visual style and warm tones across all 10 images.

Images must be optimized for web, print, and social sharing — high-resolution, clear, and appetizing.
