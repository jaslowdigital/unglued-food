Additional Notes:

Include butterflying & rolling tips for even thickness and secure filling.

Provide sauce or gravy pairings for each version (e.g., pan jus, white wine reduction, or cranberry glaze).

Offer make-ahead and reheating guidance — roulades slice beautifully when rested overnight.

Suggest serving ideas — sliced medallions over mashed potatoes, polenta, or roasted vegetables.

Add dairy-free substitutions (vegan cheese, olive oil instead of butter).

Recommend garnishes — herbs, citrus slices, roasted garlic, or pomegranate seeds.

Emphasize texture and visual presentation — tender meat, spiral filling, glossy exterior.
