Additional Notes:

Provide tips for achieving perfect layer separation (temperature control, egg whisking, proper folding).

Include dairy-free and refined sugar-free alternatives (almond milk, coconut cream, or monk fruit sweetener).

Offer serving ideas (fresh fruit, powdered sugar, whipped cream, or sauce drizzles).

Add storage guidance (refrigeration, reheat, or freezing options).

Highlight texture contrast: silky custard center, sponge top, and soft base.

Suggest holiday or regional versions (e.g., ube, tiramisu, or tres leches–style custard cakes).

Include nutritional emphasis for lightened versions (lower sugar, high-protein, or dairy-light).
