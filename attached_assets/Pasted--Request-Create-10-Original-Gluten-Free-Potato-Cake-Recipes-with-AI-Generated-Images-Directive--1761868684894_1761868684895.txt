Each recipe should include:

Step-by-step instructions (mixing, baking, cooling, frosting)

Prep time, bake time, total time

Yield / servings

Nutritional information (calories, carbs, fats, sugar, protein per serving)

Include close-up detail shots to show crumb texture and color contrast.

Maintain consistent warm, inviting tones across all 10 recipes.
