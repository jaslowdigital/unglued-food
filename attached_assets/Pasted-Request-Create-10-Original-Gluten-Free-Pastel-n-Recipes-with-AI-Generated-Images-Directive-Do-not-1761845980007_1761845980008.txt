Please develop 10 unique gluten-free pastelón recipes that creatively reimagine this Puerto Rican dish while keeping its essence — sweet plantains, savory picadillo, melted cheese, and comforting layers.

All recipes must be 100% original and not duplicate any existing recipes on the website.

Gluten-Free Classic Puerto Rican Pastelón

Gluten-Free Sweet Plantain & Beef Pastelón

Gluten-Free Chicken Sofrito Pastelón

Gluten-Free Vegetarian Pastelón with Lentils & Sweet Plantains

Gluten-Free BBQ Picadillo Pastelón with Cheese Crust)

Each recipe should include:

Step-by-step instructions (frying, layering, baking, serving)

Prep time, cook time, total time

Yield / servings

Nutritional information (calories, carbs, protein, fats, sugar, sodium per serving)

All ingredients must be certified gluten-free, including broths, sauces, and seasonings.

Recipes should preserve the sweet–savory balance of pastelón — crispy plantains, spiced filling, and gooey cheese layers.

Image Requirements:

Generate one high-quality, photorealistic image per recipe.

Images should showcase golden layered plantains, melty cheese, and rich meat or veggie filling.

Use natural lighting and warm, tropical styling (ceramic dishes, plantain slices, colorful linens).

Include close-up detail shots showing the layered cross-section.

Maintain rich golden and warm tones across all 10 images.

Images must be high-resolution, optimized for web, print, and social media.
