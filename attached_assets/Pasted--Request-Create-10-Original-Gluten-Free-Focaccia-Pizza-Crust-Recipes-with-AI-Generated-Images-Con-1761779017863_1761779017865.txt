Additional Notes:

Include flour blend guidance for best texture (rice flour, tapioca starch, potato starch, almond flour, psyllium husk).

Provide proofing and hydration tips — wet dough yields best air bubbles.

Suggest topping pairings for each flavor (cheeses, sauces, vegetables, meats).

Offer dairy-free and vegan options using plant-based cheese and milk substitutes.

Add storage and reheating tips — best when crisped in a hot oven or air fryer.

Highlight texture balance — crisp bottom, chewy crumb, aromatic crust.

Include creative serving ideas — as pizza base, sandwich bread, or appetizer flatbread.
