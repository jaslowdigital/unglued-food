🧇 Request: Create 10 Original Gluten-Free Waffle Recipes with AI-Generated Images
Content Requirements:

Please develop 10 unique gluten-free waffle recipes with the following specifications:

All recipes must be 100% original and not duplicate any existing recipes on our website.

Each recipe title must include “Gluten-Free Waffles” (examples:

Gluten-Free Waffles with Almond Flour & Vanilla Bean

Gluten-Free Buckwheat Waffles with Berries

Gluten-Free Oat Flour Waffles with Maple Butter

Gluten-Free Waffles & Ice Cream Sundae

Gluten-Free Chocolate Coconut Flour Waffles)

Each recipe should include:

Full ingredients list (flour type, liquid base, sweeteners, binding agents, flavor additions)

Step-by-step instructions (mixing, resting, cooking, and topping)

Prep time, cook time, total time

Yield / servings

Nutritional information per serving (calories, carbs, fats, protein, fiber, sugar)

All ingredients must be certified gluten-free, including flours and leavening agents.

Recipes should include a variety of flour bases (almond, oat, rice, buckwheat, tapioca, coconut, sorghum, cassava, quinoa, chickpea).

Include at least two waffle-and-ice-cream desserts that pair warm waffles with frozen or creamy toppings.

Image Requirements:

Generate one high-quality, photorealistic image per recipe.

Images should showcase crispy, golden waffles — stacked, topped, or plated with syrups, fruits, or ice cream.

Use natural lighting with breakfast or dessert-style settings — marble tables, forks, fruit bowls, drizzled syrup, melting scoops, powdered sugar dusting.

Maintain consistent warm tone and high resolution across all 10 images.

Include close-up shots showing waffle texture (crispy edges, airy interior).

Images must be optimized for web, print, and social media.

Additional Notes:

Include texture and consistency tips:

Proper waffle iron temperature for crisp vs fluffy

Resting batter for aeration

Balancing moisture across flour types

Offer dairy-free or vegan versions (coconut milk, flax eggs, etc.).

Suggest savory adaptations (herb, cheese, or veggie waffles).

Provide topping ideas (fruit, nut butters, compotes, syrups, whipped cream).

Include storage and reheating tips — freezer-friendly and toaster-crisp instructions.

Highlight each flour’s characteristics (flavor, protein content, crispness level).

Add pairing recommendations for ice cream, sauces, or beverages (coffee, tea, mimosas).
