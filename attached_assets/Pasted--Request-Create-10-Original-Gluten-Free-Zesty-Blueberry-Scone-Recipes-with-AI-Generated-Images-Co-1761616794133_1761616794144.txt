Gluten-Free Zesty Blueberry Orange Cream Scones

Gluten-Free Zesty Blueberry Lime Poppyseed Scones

Gluten-Free Zesty Blueberry Buttermilk Scones

Each recipe should include:

Complete ingredients list (including gluten-free flour blend, fat source, leaveners, fruit, zest, and glaze details)

Step-by-step baking instructions (mixing, shaping, baking, cooling, glazing)

Prep time, bake time, and total time

Yield (scones or servings)

Image Requirements:

Generate one high-quality, photorealistic image per recipe.

Maintain a consistent warm tone and bright aesthetic across all 10 images.

Include close-up shots to show flake detail, icing, and fruit color.

Images must be high-resolution, optimized for web, print, and social media.

Keep butter cold for flakiness

Avoid overmixing to maintain tender crumb

Chill dough before baking for better rise

Provide dairy-free alternatives (use coconut oil or vegan butter).

Offer sugar-free options using monk fruit or erythritol.

Suggest serving ideas: clotted cream, whipped mascarpone, lemon curd, or berry jam.

Include storage instructions (airtight container or freezer-safe options).

Highlight seasonal pairings — spring/summer brunches, Mother’s Day, or tea parties.

Recommend glaze variations (lemon, orange, vanilla, honey).
