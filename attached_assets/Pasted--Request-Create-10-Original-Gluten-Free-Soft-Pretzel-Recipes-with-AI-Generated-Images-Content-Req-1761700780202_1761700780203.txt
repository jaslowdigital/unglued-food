Proper dough hydration for gluten-free flours

How to shape pretzels (traditional twist, bites, or sticks)

Achieving golden crust via baking soda bath (or alternative for grain-free versions)

Offer flour blend guidance (rice flour, tapioca, potato starch, sorghum, xanthan gum ratios).

Suggest flavor and topping variations (seeds, herbs, sweet glazes, cheeses).

Provide dairy-free and vegan options (olive oil or coconut oil instead of butter).

Add storage and reheating instructions (best served warm; oven reheat for freshness).

Include dipping sauce recipes (cheese, honey mustard, chocolate, caramel).

Highlight nutrition-friendly alternatives (reduced sugar, high-protein flours, or low-sodium options).
