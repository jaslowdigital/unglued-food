Additional Notes:

Include preparation tips:

No need to peel delicata squash — skin is tender and edible.

Roast at high heat for caramelization (400°F–425°F).

Toss halfway for even browning.

Offer dietary variations — vegan, paleo, or dairy-free options.

Suggest pairings — turkey, pork loin, grain bowls, or quinoa salads.

Add make-ahead and storage tips (reheat in oven to restore crispness).

Provide plating ideas — on platters with herbs, or as part of a composed salad.

Highlight seasonal sourcing — best in autumn and early winter.
