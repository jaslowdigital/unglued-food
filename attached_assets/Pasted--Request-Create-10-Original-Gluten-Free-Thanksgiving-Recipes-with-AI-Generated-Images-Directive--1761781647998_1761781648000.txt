Suggest pairings (wine, mocktails, or side combinations).

Provide presentation tips — family-style serving, garnish ideas (rosemary, cranberries, orange peel curls).

Include storage instructions — refrigeration, reheating, and freezing guidelines.

Highlight cross-contamination safety for gluten-sensitive guests.

Balance the menu with flavor, texture, and color variety — roasted, creamy, crunchy, and fresh.
