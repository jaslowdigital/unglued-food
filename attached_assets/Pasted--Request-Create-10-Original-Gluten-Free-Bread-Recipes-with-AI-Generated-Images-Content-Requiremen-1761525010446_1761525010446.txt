🍞 Request: Create 10 Original Gluten-Free Bread Recipes with AI-Generated Images
Content Requirements:

Please develop 10 unique gluten-free bread recipes with the following specifications:

All recipes must be 100% original and not duplicate any existing recipes on our website.

Each recipe title must include “Gluten-Free Bread” (examples:

Gluten-Free Bread with Honey and Oats

Gluten-Free Garlic Herb Pull-Apart Bread

Gluten-Free Banana Bread with Walnuts

Each recipe should include:

Full ingredients list (with recommended gluten-free flour blends)

Step-by-step baking instructions (including proofing, rise times, and baking temperatures)

Prep time, rise time, and bake time

Yield (loaves, muffins, rolls, etc.)

Nutritional information (calories, carbs, fiber, protein, etc.)

All recipes must use certified gluten-free ingredients and emphasize proper texture and rise.

Include a variety of yeast-based, quick, and specialty breads.

Image Requirements:

Generate one high-quality, photorealistic image per recipe.

Images should display the finished bread clearly—sliced, buttered, or freshly baked for visual appeal.

Capture crumb texture, crust color, and steam where possible.

Use natural lighting and clean, bright backgrounds (e.g., wood boards, linen towels, or rustic cutting surfaces).

Highlight artisan, wholesome, and homestyle qualities.

Maintain a consistent visual style across all 10 images, suitable for both web and print.

Preferred specifications: high resolution, warm tone, appetizing focus.
