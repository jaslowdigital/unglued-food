Content Requirements:

Please develop 10 unique gluten-free fruit crisp and crumble recipes with the following specifications:

All recipes must be 100% original and not duplicate any existing recipes on our website.

Each recipe title must include “Gluten-Free” and the featured fruit (examples:

Gluten-Free Apple Cinnamon Crisp

Gluten-Free Mixed Berry Crumble

Gluten-Free Peach Almond Crisp

Gluten-Free Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble

Gluten-Free Pear & Ginger Crisp)

Each recipe should include:

Complete ingredients list (filling, topping, and optional garnishes)

Step-by-step baking instructions (fruit prep, crisp assembly, baking time, and cooling)

Prep time, bake time, and total time

Yield / servings

Nutritional information per serving (calories, sugar, carbs, fats, fiber, etc.)

All ingredients must be certified gluten-free, including oats and flours.

Recipes should balance sweetness, texture, and fruit flavor — crispy, buttery tops with juicy fruit fillings.

Image Requirements:

Generate one high-quality, photorealistic image per recipe.

Each image should showcase the crisp topping texture (golden and crunchy) and bubbling fruit filling underneath.

Use natural lighting, rustic or farmhouse-style backgrounds (cast iron pans, ceramic ramekins, linen napkins).

Include garnish details — vanilla ice cream scoops, whipped cream, or fresh herbs (mint, basil, thyme).

Maintain consistent visual tone (warm, cozy, homestyle) across all 10 recipes.

Images must be high-resolution and web/social ready.

Include tips for texture (butter temperature, mixing technique, sugar ratio).

Provide dairy-free and vegan alternatives (use coconut oil or vegan butter).

Suggest pairings and garnishes (ice cream, whipped coconut cream, yogurt).

Include at least one no-bake or skillet version for summer convenience.

Highlight seasonal adaptability — substituting fruits year-round.

Offer sugar-conscious and paleo-friendly versions using honey or maple syrup.
