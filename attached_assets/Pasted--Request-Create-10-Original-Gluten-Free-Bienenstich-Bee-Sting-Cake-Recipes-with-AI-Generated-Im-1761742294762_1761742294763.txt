Content Requirements:

Please develop 10 unique gluten-free Bienenstich (Bee Sting Cake) recipes with the following specifications:

All recipes must be 100% original and not duplicate any existing recipes on our website.

Each recipe title must include “Gluten-Free Bienenstich” or “Gluten-Free Bee Sting Cake” (examples:

Gluten-Free Bienenstich with Vanilla Custard Cream

Gluten-Free Almond Honey Bee Sting Cake

Gluten-Free Mini Bienenstich Cupcakes

Gluten-Free Vegan Bee Sting Cake with Coconut Cream

Gluten-Free Lemon Honey Bienenstich Bars)

Each recipe should include:

Full ingredients list (cake base, honey almond topping, filling or cream layer)

Step-by-step baking instructions (yeast dough, proofing, baking, layering, topping)

Prep time, rise time, bake time, total time

Yield / servings

Nutritional information per serving (calories, carbs, protein, fats, sugar, sodium, etc.)

All ingredients must be certified gluten-free (flour blends, starches, yeast, baking powder).

Recipes should preserve the classic structure: tender cake, honey-almond glaze, and creamy vanilla or custard filling — with optional modern twists.

Image Requirements:

Generate one high-quality, photorealistic image per recipe.

Images should highlight the golden honey almond topping, cream layer, and soft cake crumb.

Use natural lighting with European café-inspired styling — wooden tables, linen napkins, espresso cups, honey jars, and sliced cakes.

Include close-up shots showing texture (crisp almond layer, creamy middle).

Maintain consistent warm tones and bakery presentation across all 10 images.

Images must be high-resolution and optimized for web, print, and social media.

Best gluten-free flours (rice, sorghum, tapioca, almond) for yeasted cakes

Provide dairy-free and egg-free alternatives (plant-based milks, agar-thickened custards).

Suggest serving ideas — with espresso, honey drizzle, or fresh berries.

Include storage and make-ahead instructions (refrigeration, freezing, or component prep).

Highlight cultural origin and tradition — classic German coffeehouse dessert symbolizing sweetness and celebration.

Recommend optional flavor infusions — lavender honey, citrus zest, or almond extract for enhanced aroma.
