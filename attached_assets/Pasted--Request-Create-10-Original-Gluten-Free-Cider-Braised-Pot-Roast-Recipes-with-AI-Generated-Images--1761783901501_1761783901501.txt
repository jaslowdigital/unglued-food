Suggest sides and pairings — mashed potatoes, roasted root veggies, gluten-free bread, or polenta.

Add slow cooker and oven variations for versatility.

Include make-ahead and reheating tips (flavor improves overnight).

Highlight holiday presentation ideas — served sliced with herbs and reduced cider glaze.

Note storage and freezing instructions (airtight container up to 3 months).
