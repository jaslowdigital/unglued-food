## QUESTION-ANSWER TRAINING PAIRS

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is gluten?**
A: Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It provides elasticity and structure to baked goods but can cause serious health issues for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.

**Q: What is celiac disease?**
A: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where gluten consumption damages the small intestine lining. It affects about 1% of the population and requires a strict gluten-free diet for life.

**Q: How do I prevent cross-contamination?**
A: Use separate cutting boards, toasters, and utensils. Clean surfaces thoroughly. Store gluten-free items above gluten-containing foods. Use dedicated gluten-free cooking equipment when possible.

**Q: What flour can replace all-purpose flour?**
A: No single flour perfectly replaces all-purpose flour. Use blends combining rice flour, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum. Commercial 1:1 baking blends work well for most recipes.

**Q: Why is my gluten-free bread dense?**
A: Common causes include insufficient leavening, not enough liquid, missing xanthan gum, or overmixing. Gluten-free batters need more moisture and gentle handling than wheat-based ones.

**Q: Can I eat oats on a gluten-free diet?**
A: Only certified gluten-free oats are safe. Regular oats are often contaminated with wheat during processing. Even certified oats may cause reactions in some celiac patients.

**Q: What's the difference between celiac and gluten sensitivity?**
A: Celiac disease causes intestinal damage and has specific biomarkers. Gluten sensitivity causes symptoms without intestinal damage or positive celiac tests. Both improve with gluten-free diets.

## EXPERT KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTATION

### Gluten-Free Baking Science
- **Protein Structure**: Without gluten's protein network, alternative binding agents (xanthan gum, psyllium husk, eggs) create structure
- **Hydration Levels**: GF flours absorb liquids differently; coconut flour needs 4x more liquid than wheat flour
- **Starch Gelatinization**: Critical for texture; occurs at different temperatures for various GF starches
- **Fermentation**: GF doughs ferment faster due to higher starch availability; shorter rise times needed

### Nutritional Considerations
- **Fiber Deficit**: Many GF products lack fiber; supplement with psyllium, flax, or high-fiber GF grains
- **B-Vitamin Concerns**: GF products often aren't enriched; consider supplementation or whole grain alternatives
- **Protein Quality**: Combine different protein sources (legume flours + grain flours) for complete amino acids
- **Mineral Absorption**: Some GF grains (quinoa, amaranth) provide better mineral bioavailability

## PROBLEM-SOLUTION PAIRS

**Problem**: Gluten-free cookies spread too much
**Solution**: Chill dough for 30 minutes, reduce butter slightly, add 1/4 tsp xanthan gum, use parchment paper

**Problem**: Grainy texture in GF cakes
**Solution**: Use superfine flours, let batter rest 10 minutes before baking, ensure proper mixing time

**Problem**: GF pizza dough tears when stretching
**Solution**: Add more xanthan gum (1 tsp per cup flour), increase oil content, roll between parchment paper

**Problem**: Bland taste in GF bread
**Solution**: Add apple cider vinegar (1 tbsp), increase salt slightly, use brown sugar instead of white

## CUSTOMER INTERACTION EXAMPLES

### Successful Support Conversation
**Customer**: "My GF muffins always sink in the middle"
**Support**: "This usually happens from too much leavening or opening the oven door early. Try reducing baking powder by 25% and avoid opening the oven for the first 20 minutes."
**Result**: Customer reported perfect muffins after adjustment

### Recipe Modification Request
**Customer**: "Can I make the quinoa bowl nut-free?"
**Support**: "Absolutely! Replace almond slivers with toasted sunflower seeds and use tahini instead of almond butter in the dressing."
**Outcome**: Recipe successfully modified, added to variations section

## INDUSTRY TERMINOLOGY DEFINITIONS

**Cross-Contamination**: Unintentional gluten transfer to GF foods
**Certified Gluten-Free**: Products tested to contain <10-20 ppm gluten
**Celiac Panel**: Blood tests checking for celiac antibodies
**Dermatitis Herpetiformis**: Skin manifestation of celiac disease
**Endoscopy**: Procedure to diagnose celiac via intestinal biopsy
**FODMAP**: Fermentable carbohydrates that may cause digestive issues
**Gliadin**: Component of gluten that triggers celiac response
**Hidden Gluten**: Gluten in unexpected sources (soy sauce, medications)
**Leaky Gut**: Increased intestinal permeability from gluten damage
**Modified Food Starch**: May contain gluten unless specified
**Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity**: Gluten intolerance without celiac disease
**Parts Per Million (PPM)**: Measurement for gluten content
**Refractory Celiac**: Celiac that doesn't respond to GF diet
**Tissue Transglutaminase (tTG)**: Primary celiac antibody test
**Villi**: Intestinal projections damaged by celiac disease
